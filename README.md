# Shopify custom fields (non-official version)

This is a fixed version of the original Shopify custom fields javascript tool (https://github.com/freakdesign/shopify-custom-fields).

- Click on 'Collections' on the side menu.
- Find and click on the collection you wish to edit the metafields of.
- Activate the bookmarklet.
